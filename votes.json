All other statements of the previous vote are kept as is.\n\nA simple majority of voices wins, for (as we can see) not so many people are voting at all. This vote's duration is 24 hours too.", "Begin": 1643320271.182, "End": 1643475265.902057, "936377827698282516": {"votes": {"Agree": 108, "Disagree": 1, "Reservations": 1}}}}
